# parallax-3d-lens-effect

Webpack boilerplate to create 3D lens parallax effect by moving mouse using HTML/CSS/JS.
JavaScript is used to pass the mouse coordinates into CSS as variables and create a "rain effect".

To generate static HTML with assets from their source files is used the [html-bundler-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webdiscus/html-bundler-webpack-plugin).

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="docs/images/parallax-3d-lens-effect.gif" alt="Parallax 3D lens effect demo">
</div>

> This example uses the assets created by @agragregra WebDesign Master.
